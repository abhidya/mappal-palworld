"""Emit union/avatars.json: for each player UID, the real SK_Player_* part list
their save recorded, as time RUNS covering the whole history.

This is the APPEARANCE half of the builder-avatar feature. The other half —
which player is responsible for a given piece — is `build_player_uid` on the map
object itself (union/builders_<base>.json).

Everything here is recorded data:
  who    the UID keys are the Players/<UID>.sav files that exist in the history.
  when   the run boundaries are the snapshots at which that player's
         PlayerCharacterMakeData actually CHANGED (player_index.py compares the
         git-LFS oid of the .sav blob, so "unchanged" means the bytes were
         literally identical, not that we guessed).
  look   the part list resolved from BodyMeshName / HeadMeshName / HairMeshName
         and the equipment/skin ids through the GAME'S OWN character-creation
         data tables (resolve_players.py -> player_parts.json). No name-to-mesh
         mapping is invented here.

A look whose parts could not be resolved to real extracted GLBs is dropped
rather than substituted, so a player with no resolvable appearance simply has no
run at that time and no avatar is drawn.
